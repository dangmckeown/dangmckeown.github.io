<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I'm part of a 'Draft League', using the scores from fantasy.premierleague.com. Now there's an automatic-updating league table to show how badly taking Leonardo Ulloa over Jamie Vardy is hurting me, among other things.</p>

<p>The app is built in PHP, using data from the fantasy.premierleague.com API</p>

<h3>The draft</h3>

<p>On the day of the Community Shield match between Arsenal and Chelsea, we gathered in the Porterhouse near covent garden, clutching handfuls of notes, ready for our inaugural Fantasy League draft.</p>

<h3>The rules:</h3>

<ul><li>Take it in turns to pick.</li><li>
The last manager to pick in round one gets first pick in round two and the picking order is reversed</li><li>
Pick a squad of 15: two goalies, five defenders, five midfielders, three attackers</li><li>
The real game-changer: pick no more than one player per Premier League team</li><li>
Don't use any tech - bring your research with you</li></ul>
<p>The first round of the draft went as might be expected: Rooney and Aguero, top scorers from last year, were quickly off the table. The second round was where the 'one player from each team' rule came into play. Pete's decision to hit West Brom early and take Saido Berahino led to a run on West Brom assets. Then, with all of Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City and Liverpool to choose from, I snapped up Liam Cresswell from West Ham.</p>
